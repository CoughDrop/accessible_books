AccessibleBooks

Tarheel Reader is a great tool, but needs just a little help in
its programmatic access. Also this gem supports retrieving 
accessible books from other sources with a similar formatting,
including checking the head attribute of an HTML response for directions
on where to find the JSON-formatted data for an online book.
